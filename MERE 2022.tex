\begin{abstract}
Meta-research analysis. Where is the spotlight shining on when it comes to inequality of opportunity in the research career? Where does the academia invest their resources when studying the phenomenon? 
We strive to address one of the most important ethical issues in academia today: equality of opportunity. By identifying known factors of discrimination we looked at where most of the research efforts are channelled into when investigating the issue of inequality of opportunity in the research career.

\section{Introduction}
Social protest movements such as \href{https://hipatiapress.com/hpjournals/index.php/hse/article/view/10545/3659}{\#MeToo} or \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2021.12.009}{\#BlackLivesMatter} have highlighted the need for greater diversity, equity, and inclusion at scientific institutions worldwide. In this article, we decided to conduct a meta-research analysis to find where the spotlight is shining regarding inequality of opportunity in the research career in order to spot the academia's coverage of the phenomenon.

\begin{definition}
\href{https://languages.oup.com/}{Discrimination} is the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people.
\end{definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Research question(s)}
Are there situations of discrimination when accessing a research career? If so, what are the possible causes of that discrimination? When studying this phenomenon, what has been the general tendency for the past five years?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methodology}
We used the \href{https://www.scopus.com/}{SCOPUS} search tool to do all tasks above, which contains an extensive database of multidisciplinary scientific publications.
\subsection{SCOPUS}
SCOPUS uniquely combines a comprehensive, expertly curated abstract and citation database with enriched data and linked scholarly literature across various disciplines. It quickly finds relevant and authoritative research, identifies experts, and provides access to reliable data, metrics, and analytical tools.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Research procedure}
We based the procedure of our analysis on selecting a set of articles that met the condition of dealing with discrimination in academia for \textbf{any} cause and then analyzing how many articles were related to which types of discrimination. 

Defining a data-set \textbf{beforehand} instead of searching for publications on each type of discrimination, had an apparent aim: avoiding the introduction of bias in our analysis.

\subsection{Set of publications to be analyzed} 
We defined our inclusion criteria as those contained in the \textit{title/abstract}: \textbf{inequality}, \textbf{discrimination}, or \textbf{equality}. We also included words and concepts such as \textbf{academic career} and \textbf{research career}. From the initial set of publications, we analyzed how many of them dealt with discrimination based on gender, race, and sexual orientation. This analysis was also performed by searching for keywords in the title or abstract of the publications. 

%\subsubsection{}
\subsubsection{SCOPUS QUERY}
\textit{( TITLE-ABS-KEY (inequality) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH (equality) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (discrimination)) AND (TITLE-ABS-KEY ("academic career") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH ("research career") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY-AUTH ("researcher career")) and not (TITLE-ABS-KEY (women) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (machism) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (race) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (racial) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (ethnic) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (lgtbq) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (lgbtq) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (homosexual) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (homosexuality) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (gay) or TITLE-ABS-KEY (lesbian)) AND ( EXCLUDE ( DOCTYPE,"ch" ) OR EXCLUDE ( DOCTYPE,"bk"))}

\subsubsection{}
After analyzing the most common types of discrimination, we discarded these papers. Then, we analyzed the remaining ones in search of other types of discrimination. This search was performed by selecting a random sample of papers and analyzing their subject matter. We carried the procedure out iteratively until no new causes of discrimination could be determined, at which point we ended the search. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Academia tendency for the past five years: text analysis}
We scrapped the PDF selection using \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python} and then processed the data with common data handling libraries and Natural Language Processing tools such as \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/}{Pandas} and \href{https://www.nltk.org/}{NLTK}. 

To achieve a clean text to work with, we removed all special characters and punctuation; we also erased the English stop-words. Stop-words are available in abundance in any human language. By removing these words, we remove the low-level information from our text in order to give more focus to the high-level information. The complete Google Colab Notebook can be found  \href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IjIltXAYM-fAM2dUuPyqpsezf4HZf19G?usp=sharing}{here.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
\subsection{SCOPUS Query Search}
Two hundred eighty-four articles met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Of these 284, 220 articles dealt with \textbf{gender discrimination}, 24 with \textbf{racial discrimination}, and only 2 with \textbf{sexual orientation discrimination}. 

Subsequent analysis of the remaining 38 articles allowed us to find the following causes of discrimination: socioeconomic conditions, age, and disability. We found 14 publications on \textbf{social class conditions}, six on \textbf{ageism}, and five articles on \textbf{disability}. The remaining 13 articles were analyzed, but we did not find new types of discrimination.

\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tendency study}
Regarding the tendency study, only 66,55\% of the articles found in SCOPUS were open access. Therefore, we only applied the quantitative analysis of the word occurrences on this ~67\% accessible sample.

\section{Discussion}
According to the results obtained from the analysis, we can conclude that the main object of the study is gender discrimination, representing more than 75\% of all the analyzed articles. It is also clear that the number of articles studying this type of phenomenon has a growing tendency, not to say its number increases yearly. It shows a concern that researchers themselves try to detect and describe. The slight drop in 2022 does not appear significant at first glance\ref{tab2}.

While it is true that the distribution of articles has increased across all types of discrimination, in the case of racial discrimination, it is particularly significant. This particularly sharp increase seems to indicate that there has been a recent increase in interest in racial discrimination in academia, possibly due to the impact of movements such as \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2021.12.009}{\#BlackLivesMatter} that developed shortly before this increase.

According to the scientific literature we based the research on, there is also an iterative element: the crucial role played by the institutions when it comes to remedying this type of situation. From our point of view, it is noteworthy to highlight the possible relationship between these last two conclusions: the academic environment is interested in addressing such a funding problem.

This perspective is a silver lining. The future outlook on discrimination in academia may be bright. According to the results of \href{https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12549}{recent studies}, these changes in more egalitarian academia may have already begun to have an impact since these researchers detected a decrease in the gender gap among post-doc students, which was not reflected among faculty. In other words, these measures that can be taken at the institutional level have already begun to affect the younger generations. They will gradually permeate the rest of the university and research institutes.
